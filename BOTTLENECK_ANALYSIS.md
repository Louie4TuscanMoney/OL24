## üö® CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS (MUST TEST IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. BetOnline Scraper Reliability ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Probability of Failure:** 70%  
**Impact if Fails:** Cannot get odds ‚Üí Cannot place bets

**Potential Issues:**
- Anti-bot detection (Cloudflare, captcha)
- IP blocking after repeated scrapes
- Rate limiting (scraping every 5 seconds)
- Page structure changes
- Timeout errors

**Testing:**
```bash
cd "Action/3. Bet Online/1. Scrape"
python3 betonline_scraper.py

# Run 20 times in a row
for i in {1..20}; do
    echo "Scrape $i"
    python3 betonline_scraper.py
    sleep 5
done
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 20/20 scrapes succeed
- No captchas
- No IP blocks
- Average time <2 seconds

**Mitigation if Fails:**
- Increase interval to 10-15 seconds (less aggressive)
- Add random delays (4-8 seconds, human-like)
- Use `undetected-chromedriver` (stealth mode)
- Deploy residential proxy ($50/month - Bright Data, Oxylabs)
- **Backup Plan:** Manual odds entry or paid odds API

**Priority:** FIX TODAY

---

### 2. NBA API Rate Limiting ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Probability of Failure:** 50%  
**Impact if Fails:** Cannot get live scores ‚Üí No predictions

**Potential Issues:**
- Rate limit: 60 requests/minute (unofficial)
- With 10 games + 10-second polling = 60 req/min (at limit!)
- Timeouts during high traffic
- API downtime (rare but possible)

**Testing:**
```python
# test_nba_api_rate_limit.py
from nba_api.live.nba.endpoints import scoreboard
import time

# Test 100 requests in 60 seconds
for i in range(100):
    start = time.time()
    try:
        data = scoreboard.ScoreBoard().get_dict()
        elapsed = (time.time() - start) * 1000
        print(f"{i+1}: {elapsed:.0f}ms - OK")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"{i+1}: FAILED - {e}")
    time.sleep(0.6)  # 100/60 = 1.67 req/sec
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 100/100 succeed
- No 429 errors (rate limit)
- Average latency <300ms

**Mitigation if Fails:**
- Increase polling interval to 15-20 seconds (acceptable)
- Implement caching (10-second TTL)
- Use single request for all games (more efficient)
- **Backup Plan:** Use NBA.com direct scraping or ESPN API

**Priority:** TEST TODAY

---

### 3. Model Prediction Speed Under Load ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Probability of Failure:** 40%  
**Impact if Fails:** Miss betting windows (games move fast)

**Potential Issues:**
- Model loading takes too long (cold start)
- Prediction latency increases with multiple games
- Memory issues with 10+ concurrent predictions
- Disk I/O bottleneck reading model files

**Current Performance (Single Game):**
- Model load: Unknown (test needed)
- Prediction: ~80ms (estimated from docs)

**Target Performance (10 Games):**
- Model load: <2 seconds (one-time)
- Prediction per game: <200ms
- Total for 10 games (parallel): <1 second

**Testing:**
```python
# test_ml_performance.py
import time
import pickle
import torch
from pathlib import Path

# Test 1: Load time
start = time.time()
dejavu = pickle.load(open("Action/1. ML/1. Dejavu Deployment/dejavu_k500.pkl", "rb"))
lstm = torch.load("Action/1. ML/1. Dejavu Deployment/lstm_best.pth")
load_time = (time.time() - start) * 1000
print(f"Model load time: {load_time:.0f}ms")

# Test 2: Prediction time (single)
pattern = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 9, 8, 7, 6]
start = time.time()
# prediction = ensemble.predict(pattern)
predict_time = (time.time() - start) * 1000
print(f"Single prediction: {predict_time:.0f}ms")

# Test 3: 10 predictions
start = time.time()
for i in range(10):
    # prediction = ensemble.predict(pattern)
    pass
batch_time = (time.time() - start) * 1000
print(f"10 predictions: {batch_time:.0f}ms ({batch_time/10:.0f}ms avg)")
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Load time <2 seconds
- Single prediction <200ms
- 10 predictions <2 seconds

**Mitigation if Fails:**
- Load models once at startup (not per prediction)
- Use ONNX export for faster inference
- Batch predictions if possible
- Cache recent predictions (10-second TTL)
- **Backup Plan:** Use simpler model (Dejavu only, 6.17 MAE)

**Priority:** TEST DAY 1

### 4. WebSocket Connection Stability ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Probability of Failure:** 60%  
**Impact if Fails:** Frontend goes dark (data still works, just no UI)

**Potential Issues:**
- Connections drop randomly
- Doesn't reconnect automatically
- Can't handle multiple clients
- Broadcasting slow with 10+ clients

**Testing:**
```python
# test_websocket_stress.py
import asyncio
import websockets

async def test_client(client_id):
    uri = "ws://localhost:8765"
    try:
        async with websockets.connect(uri) as ws:
            print(f"Client {client_id}: Connected")
            
            # Stay connected for 5 minutes
            for i in range(300):
                msg = await asyncio.wait_for(ws.recv(), timeout=2.0)
                print(f"Client {client_id}: Received message")
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
                
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Client {client_id}: FAILED - {e}")

async def test_multiple_clients(num_clients=10):
    tasks = [test_client(i) for i in range(num_clients)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Run
asyncio.run(test_multiple_clients(10))
```

**Success Criteria:**
- 10 clients connect successfully
- All stay connected for 5 minutes
- No dropped messages
- No memory leaks

**Mitigation if Fails:**
- Add auto-reconnect logic in frontend
- Implement heartbeat/ping-pong
- Increase connection limits
- **Backup Plan:** Poll-based updates (HTTP endpoint every 5 seconds)

**Priority:** TEST DAY 2

---

### 5. Edge Opportunity Frequency ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (Business, not technical)  
**Probability:** 80% (edges WILL be rare)  
**Impact:** Fewer bets than expected ‚Üí Lower profits

**The Reality:**
- Your model MAE: 5.39 points
- Market odds are usually accurate within 3-4 points
- For a 2-point edge, ML must be ~7 points better than market
- **Expected edge frequency: 10-20% of games**

**On a 10-game night:**
- Optimistic: 3-4 edges detected
- Realistic: 1-2 edges detected
- Pessimistic: 0 edges

**This is NORMAL. Quality > Quantity.**

**Testing:**
Use preseason games on Day 3 to measure actual edge frequency.

**Success Criteria:**
- At least 1 edge per 10 games (10% rate)
- Average edge size >2 points when detected

**Mitigation if Low:**
- Lower threshold to 1.5 points (more bets, smaller edges)
- Add more bet types (totals, player props, live betting)
- Accept that some nights will have 0 bets (patience!)
- **Backup Plan:** None needed, this is expected

**Priority:** MEASURE DAY 3-5

---

### 6. Model Accuracy on 2025 Data ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Probability of Drift:** 50%  
**Impact:** Inaccurate predictions ‚Üí Bad bets ‚Üí Losses

**The Reality:**
- Your model trained on 2015-2021 data
- It's now 2025 (4 years later)
- NBA has changed: new players, new rules, different pace
- **Model drift is EXPECTED**

**Your training performance:**
- MAE: 5.39 points
- Coverage: 94.6%

**Realistic 2025 performance:**
- Optimistic: 5.5-6.5 MAE (slight drift)
- Realistic: 6.0-7.5 MAE (moderate drift)
- Pessimistic: 8.0+ MAE (significant drift)

**Testing:**
Day 3 (Oct 18): Test on live preseason games
- Record predictions
- Compare to actual results
- Calculate MAE and coverage
- **This is your MOST IMPORTANT test**

**Success Criteria:**
- MAE <8.0 (acceptable for preseason)
- Coverage >85%
- No systematic bias (not always over/under predicting)

**Mitigation if Poor:**
- Collect Week 1 regular season data
- Retrain ensemble weights
- Recalibrate conformal wrapper
- Add calibration offset if systematic bias
- **Backup Plan:** Paper trade for 2 weeks while collecting data, then retrain

**Priority:** TEST DAY 3 (CRITICAL)

## ‚ö° MEDIUM-PRIORITY BOTTLENECKS

### 7. Integration Bugs Between Components
**Risk:** 60% probability  
**Impact:** System crashes, errors

**Test:** Full integration test (Day 1)  
**Mitigation:** Debug and fix immediately

### 8. Database Write Bottlenecks
**Risk:** 30% probability  
**Impact:** Data loss, slow writes

**Test:** High-volume write test (Day 2)  
**Mitigation:** Use async writes, batch inserts

### 9. Frontend Rendering with 10+ Games
**Risk:** 50% probability  
**Impact:** UI lag, poor UX

**Test:** Load 15 games in dashboard (Day 5)  
**Mitigation:** Virtualization, pagination, lazy loading

### 10. Server Resource Constraints
**Risk:** 40% probability  
**Impact:** Slowdowns under load

**Test:** Monitor CPU/RAM during 10-game simulation (Day 2)  
**Mitigation:** Close other apps, upgrade hardware if needed

## üí° QUICK WINS (If Short on Time)

**If you only have 2 days:**
1. Test BetOnline scraper ‚Üê MUST DO
2. Test on 1 live preseason game ‚Üê MUST DO
3. Run integration test ‚Üê MUST DO
4. Launch with manual monitoring ‚Üê ACCEPTABLE

**If you only have 1 day:**
1. Test BetOnline scraper
