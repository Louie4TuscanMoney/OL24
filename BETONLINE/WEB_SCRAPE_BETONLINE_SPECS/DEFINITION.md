# BetOnline Web Scraping - Definition

**Real-Time NBA Score Collection for Live Forecasting**

---

## What is This?

A **real-time web scraping system** built with Crawlee (Node.js) to collect live NBA game scores and betting odds from BetOnline.ag. This data feeds into your ML forecasting pipeline (Informer, Conformal, Dejavu) for live predictions.

---

## Why BetOnline.ag?

1. **Live Scores:** Real-time score updates during games
2. **Betting Odds:** Market-implied probabilities
3. **Game Coverage:** Comprehensive NBA game listings
4. **Structured Data:** Relatively consistent HTML structure
5. **Approved Access:** You have permission to scrape (with respect)

---

## What is Crawlee?

**Crawlee** is a modern Node.js web scraping framework by Apify that provides:

- **Browser Automation:** Playwright/Puppeteer integration
- **Anti-Bot Evasion:** Stealth plugins, proxy rotation, user-agent management
- **Request Queue:** Intelligent crawling with retries and backoff
- **Session Management:** Cookies, state persistence
- **Scaling:** Parallel crawling with concurrency control
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript support

**Why Not BeautifulSoup/Selenium?**
- Crawlee is specifically designed for production scraping
- Better anti-detection out of the box
- More resilient to failures
- Modern async/await syntax
- Built-in monitoring and logging

## Key Components

### 1. Game Discovery
- Scrape main basketball pages
- Identify live games
- Extract game URLs and start times
- Schedule monitoring

### 2. Live Score Monitoring
- Poll individual game pages
- Extract scores every 30-60 seconds
- Focus on Q1 start â†’ halftime (critical window)
- Store with timestamps

### 3. Anti-Detection
- Proxy rotation (residential IPs)
- User-agent rotation
- Stealth plugin (hide automation markers)
- Rate limiting (respectful delays)
- Session management

### 4. Data Processing
- Convert event data to time series
- Minute-by-minute format (0-47 minutes)
- Calculate differentials
- Add temporal features
- Validate and store

### 5. Integration
- Export for Informer (18-min input â†’ 6-min forecast)
- Export for Conformal (calibration patterns)
- Export for Dejavu (pattern database)
- Real-time streaming to prediction API

---

## Technical Stack

**Scraping:**
- Crawlee 3.x (Node.js framework)
- Playwright (browser automation)
- puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth (anti-detection)

**Storage:**
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL (time-series data)
- Redis (caching, rate limiting)

**Processing:**
- Node.js (data transformation)
- Python (ML model integration)

**Deployment:**
- Docker containers
- AWS EC2 or Kubernetes
- PM2 (process management)
- Grafana (monitoring)

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Pre-Game Analysis
- Scrape odds and team info before game
- Feed into forecasting models as context

### 2. Live Forecasting
- Monitor scores in real-time
- At 6:00 2Q: Input to models
- Predict halftime differential
- Update continuously

### 3. Model Validation
- Compare predictions vs actual outcomes
- Track model performance live
- Recalibrate if needed

### 4. Betting Intelligence
- Compare model predictions to market odds
- Identify value opportunities
- Risk management

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Bot Detection
**Problem:** BetOnline has anti-scraping measures  
**Solution:** 
- Stealth plugin (hide webdriver)
- Residential proxies
- Human-like delays and behaviors

### Challenge 2: Rate Limiting
**Problem:** Too many requests â†’ 429 errors  
**Solution:**
- Conservative rate limits (3-5 sec/request)
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Request BetOnline for guidance

### Challenge 3: Dynamic Content
**Problem:** Scores loaded via JavaScript  
**Solution:**
- Use Playwright (full browser)
- Wait for DOM elements
- Handle loading states

### Challenge 4: Data Quality
**Problem:** Missing/inconsistent data  
**Solution:**
- Robust validation
- Interpolation for missing minutes
- Store raw + processed data

### Challenge 5: Reliability
**Problem:** Scraper crashes, network issues  
**Solution:**
- Automatic retries
- Health monitoring
- Alerts on failures
- Process auto-restart (PM2)
