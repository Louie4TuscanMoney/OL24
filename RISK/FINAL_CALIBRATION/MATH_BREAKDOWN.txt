**Date:** October 15, 2025

================================================================================
SECTION 1: ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM BET FORMULA
================================================================================

### Formula 1.1: Absolute Maximum (The Hard Rule)

Bet_max = B_0 × α_max

Where:
  Bet_max = Maximum allowed bet (never exceeded)
  B_0 = Original starting bankroll ($5,000)
  α_max = Maximum fraction (0.15 = 15%)

Example:
  B_0 = $5,000
  α_max = 0.15
  
  Bet_max = $5,000 × 0.15 = $750

This value NEVER changes, regardless of:
  - Current bankroll ($3,000 or $10,000)
  - Recommended bet from other layers
  - Edge size or confidence level
  - Power modes or TURBO states

---

### Formula 1.2: Calibration Function

Bet_final = min(Bet_recommended, Bet_max)

Example 1:
  Bet_recommended = $500
  Bet_max = $750
  Bet_final = min($500, $750) = $500 (under limit, no reduction)

Example 2:
  Bet_recommended = $1,750
  Bet_max = $750
  Bet_final = min($1,750, $750) = $750 (capped)

---

### Formula 1.3: Reduction Percentage

Reduction_pct = (Bet_recommended - Bet_final) / Bet_recommended

Example:
  Bet_recommended = $1,750
  Bet_final = $750
  
  Reduction_pct = ($1,750 - $750) / $1,750
                = $1,000 / $1,750
                = 0.571 (57.1% reduction applied)

================================================================================
SECTION 2: CONFIDENCE SCALING FORMULAS
================================================================================

### Formula 2.1: ML Confidence Factor

f_confidence = max(0.60, min(1.05, a + b × confidence))

Where:
  a = 0.45 (intercept)
  b = 0.60 (slope)
  confidence = ML confidence from interval width (0-1)

Example:
  High confidence (0.95):
    f_confidence = 0.45 + 0.60 × 0.95 = 1.02 (slight boost)
  
  Medium confidence (0.75):
    f_confidence = 0.45 + 0.60 × 0.75 = 0.90 (10% reduction)
  
  Low confidence (0.50):
    f_confidence = 0.45 + 0.60 × 0.50 = 0.75 (25% reduction)

Clipped to [0.60, 1.05] range

---

### Formula 2.2: Edge Size Factor

f_edge = max(0.70, min(1.00, edge / 0.20))

Where edge is the ML-market probability difference

Example:
  Large edge (0.25 = 25%):
    f_edge = 0.25 / 0.20 = 1.25 → capped at 1.00
  
  Moderate edge (0.15 = 15%):
    f_edge = 0.15 / 0.20 = 0.75 → below cap, use 0.75
  
  Small edge (0.08 = 8%):
    f_edge = 0.08 / 0.20 = 0.40 → floored at 0.70

Range: [0.70, 1.00]

---

### Formula 2.3: Calibration Status Factor

f_calibration = {
    EXCELLENT: 1.05,
    GOOD: 1.00,
    FAIR: 0.90,
    POOR: 0.70,
    VERY_POOR: 0.50
}

Based on model calibration monitor from enhancement layer

---

### Formula 2.4: Bankroll Health Factor

f_health = max(0.60, min(1.00, B_current / B_0))

Where:
  B_current = Current bankroll
  B_0 = Original bankroll

Example:
  Up 50% ($7,500):
    f_health = $7,500 / $5,000 = 1.50 → capped at 1.00
  
  Even ($5,000):
    f_health = $5,000 / $5,000 = 1.00
  
  Down 20% ($4,000):
    f_health = $4,000 / $5,000 = 0.80
  
  Down 50% ($2,500):
    f_health = $2,500 / $5,000 = 0.50 → floored at 0.60

Range: [0.60, 1.00]

---

### Formula 2.5: Combined Scaling

Bet_scaled = Bet_capped × f_confidence × f_edge × f_calibration × f_health

Where Bet_capped = min(Bet_recommended, Bet_max)

Final bet:
Bet_final = min(Bet_scaled, Bet_max)  # Can't exceed max even after scaling

Example:
  Bet_capped = $750
  f_confidence = 0.92
  f_edge = 0.95
  f_calibration = 1.05
  f_health = 0.90
  
  Bet_scaled = $750 × 0.92 × 0.95 × 1.05 × 0.90
             = $750 × 0.832
             = $624
  
  Bet_final = min($624, $750) = $624

Final bet: $624 (17% reduction from max due to moderate health)

================================================================================
SECTION 3: PORTFOLIO-WIDE CALIBRATION
================================================================================

### Formula 3.1: Total Exposure Limit

Total_max = B_0 × α_total

Where α_total = 0.50 (50% of original bankroll)

Example:
  B_0 = $5,000
  Total_max = $5,000 × 0.50 = $2,500

Maximum total across ALL bets: $2,500

---

### Formula 3.2: Proportional Scaling

If Σ(Bet_i) > Total_max:

  scaling_factor = Total_max / Σ(Bet_i)
  
  Bet_i_final = Bet_i × scaling_factor for all i

Example:
  6 bets: [$750, $750, $600, $500, $550, $600]
  Total: $3,750
  Limit: $2,500
  
  Exceeds: YES ($3,750 > $2,500)
  
  Scaling factor = $2,500 / $3,750 = 0.667
  
  Scaled bets: [$500, $500, $400, $333, $367, $400]
  Total: $2,500 (exactly at limit)

All bets reduced proportionally to stay within portfolio limit

---

### Formula 3.3: Reserve Requirement

Reserve_required = B_0 × 0.50

Must maintain: B_current - Σ(Bet_i) ≥ Reserve_required

Example:
  Original: $5,000
  Reserve: $2,500
  Current: $4,800
  Proposed bets: $2,500 total
  
  Check: $4,800 - $2,500 = $2,300
  Required: $2,500
  
  FAIL: $2,300 < $2,500
  
  Action: Reduce bets to maintain reserve
  Max bets: $4,800 - $2,500 = $2,300

This ensures you always have 50% of original bankroll in reserve

================================================================================
SECTION 4: SAFETY MODE MATHEMATICS
================================================================================

### Formula 4.1: Safety Mode Determination

Mode = {
  GREEN:  if calibration ∈ {EXCELLENT, GOOD} AND B_current > 0.80 × B_0 AND win_rate > 0.55
  YELLOW: if calibration = FAIR OR (0.60 < B_current/B_0 < 0.80) OR (0.50 < win_rate < 0.55)
  RED:    if calibration ∈ {POOR, VERY_POOR} OR B_current < 0.60 × B_0 OR win_rate < 0.50
}

---

### Formula 4.2: Mode-Specific Limits

α_max(Mode) = {
  GREEN:  0.15 (15% of original)
  YELLOW: 0.12 (12% of original)
  RED:    0.08 (8% of original)
}

Example transitions:
  GREEN: Max bet = $750
  → YELLOW triggered: Max bet = $600 (20% reduction)
  → RED triggered: Max bet = $400 (47% reduction from GREEN)

---

### Formula 4.3: Drawdown-Triggered Mode

Mode_DD = {
  GREEN:  if DD < 0.15
  YELLOW: if 0.15 ≤ DD < 0.25
  RED:    if DD ≥ 0.25
}

Where DD = (Peak_bankroll - Current_bankroll) / Peak_bankroll

Example:
  Peak: $6,000
  Current: $4,500
  DD = ($6,000 - $4,500) / $6,000 = 0.25 (25% drawdown)
  
  Mode_DD = RED (hit 25% threshold)
  Max bet: $400 (8% of original)

================================================================================
SECTION 5: PROGRESSIVE BETTING LIMITS
================================================================================

### Formula 5.1: Maximum Cumulative in Progression

Max_progression_total = B_0 × 0.30

Example:
  B_0 = $5,000
  Max_progression_total = $1,500

If in 3-level progression:
  Level 1: $750
  Level 2: Can add max $750 more (total $1,500)
  Level 3: Already at limit ($1,500), can't add more

This prevents Decision Tree from exceeding 30% of original in single sequence

---

### Formula 5.2: Level-Specific Caps

For progression Level N, bet is minimum of:

Bet_N = min(
    Bet_required,           # What's needed to recover
    B_0 × 0.15,            # Absolute maximum
    B_current × 0.20,       # 20% of current
    Max_prog - Σ(Bets_previous)  # Total progression limit
)

Example (Level 2):
  Bet_required = $1,800 (to recover Level 1 loss)
  B_0 × 0.15 = $750
  B_current × 0.20 = $4,250 × 0.20 = $850
  Max_prog - Previous = $1,500 - $750 = $750
  
  Bet_2 = min($1,800, $750, $850, $750) = $750

Capped at $750 by multiple limits

================================================================================
SECTION 6: RISK OF RUIN WITH CALIBRATION
================================================================================

### Formula 6.1: Probability of Ruin (Modified)

With fixed fraction f of original bankroll:

P(Ruin) = (q/p)^(1/f)

Where:
  p = Win probability
  q = 1 - p
  f = Fraction of original bankroll per bet

Example:
  p = 0.60
  f = 0.15 (15% per bet)
  
  P(Ruin) = (0.40/0.60)^(1/0.15)
          = (0.667)^6.67
          = 0.088 (8.8% risk of ruin)

With f = 0.20 (20% per bet):
  P(Ruin) = (0.667)^5 = 0.132 (13.2%)

15% rule reduces ruin risk by 33% vs 20% rule

---

### Formula 6.2: Expected Survival Time

E[T_ruin] = B_0 / ((p - q) × f × B_0)
          = 1 / ((p - q) × f)

Example:
  p = 0.60, q = 0.40
  f = 0.15
  
  E[T_ruin] = 1 / ((0.60 - 0.40) × 0.15)
            = 1 / 0.03
            = 33.3 bets

Expected to survive 33 bets before ruin (if constantly betting max)

With f = 0.20:
  E[T_ruin] = 1 / 0.04 = 25 bets

15% rule extends survival by 33% vs 20%

---

### Formula 6.3: Maximum Drawdown Probability

For fixed fraction f, maximum drawdown distribution:

P(DD > x) = (q/p)^(x/f)

Example:
  f = 0.15, x = 0.30 (30% drawdown)
  p = 0.60
  
  P(DD > 0.30) = (0.667)^(0.30/0.15)
               = (0.667)^2
               = 0.445 (44.5%)

44.5% chance of experiencing >30% drawdown

With f = 0.20:
  P(DD > 0.30) = (0.667)^1.5 = 0.544 (54.4%)

15% rule reduces severe drawdown probability

================================================================================
SECTION 7: SCALING FACTOR MATHEMATICS
================================================================================

### Formula 7.1: Confidence Scaling Function

S_confidence(c) = a + b × c

Where:
  c = Confidence level (0-1)
  a = 0.45 (minimum at c=0)
  b = 0.60 (slope)

Result capped at [0.60, 1.05]

Example values:
  c = 0.50: S = 0.45 + 0.60×0.50 = 0.75
  c = 0.75: S = 0.45 + 0.60×0.75 = 0.90
  c = 0.90: S = 0.45 + 0.60×0.90 = 0.99
  c = 0.95: S = 0.45 + 0.60×0.95 = 1.02

At 95% confidence, slight boost to 102%

---

### Formula 7.2: Edge Scaling Function

S_edge(e) = e / e_ref

Where:
  e = Actual edge (0-0.30)
  e_ref = Reference edge (0.20 = 20%)

Result capped at [0.70, 1.00]

Example values:
  e = 0.25: S = 0.25/0.20 = 1.25 → capped at 1.00
  e = 0.15: S = 0.15/0.20 = 0.75
  e = 0.10: S = 0.10/0.20 = 0.50 → floored at 0.70

---

### Formula 7.3: Combined Scaling

S_combined = S_confidence × S_edge × S_calibration × S_health

Example:
  S_confidence = 0.92
  S_edge = 0.95
  S_calibration = 1.05
  S_health = 0.90
  
  S_combined = 0.92 × 0.95 × 1.05 × 0.90
             = 0.832

Final bet: Bet_max × S_combined = $750 × 0.832 = $624

---

### Formula 7.4: Final Calibration Formula (Complete)

Bet_final = min(
    Bet_recommended,                           # From previous layers
    B_0 × α_mode,                              # Mode-specific max
    (B_0 × α_mode) × S_combined,               # Scaled within mode limit
    B_current × 0.25                           # Never >25% of current
)

Where:
  α_mode ∈ {0.15, 0.12, 0.08} depending on safety mode

This is the master formula combining all constraints

================================================================================
SECTION 8: RESERVE REQUIREMENT MATHEMATICS
================================================================================

### Formula 8.1: Minimum Reserve

R_min = B_0 × 0.50

Must always maintain: B_current ≥ R_min

Example:
  B_0 = $5,000
  R_min = $2,500
  
  If B_current = $2,800:
    Available to bet = $2,800 - $2,500 = $300
    
  Even if recommended bet is $750, can only bet $300

This is the absolute floor - never drop below 50% of original

---

### Formula 8.2: Available Capital

Available = B_current - R_min - Σ(Active_bets)

Example:
  Current bankroll: $4,500
  Reserve: $2,500
  Active bets: $500 (pending)
  
  Available = $4,500 - $2,500 - $500 = $1,500

Can allocate up to $1,500 across new bets

---

### Formula 8.3: Capital Allocation Limit

For n proposed bets:

If Σ(Bet_i) > Available:
  Scale all: Bet_i_final = Bet_i × (Available / Σ(Bet_i))

Example:
  Available: $1,500
  Proposed: [$750, $600, $500, $400] = $2,250
  
  Exceeds: YES
  
  Scaling: $1,500 / $2,250 = 0.667
  
  Final: [$500, $400, $333, $267] = $1,500

================================================================================
SECTION 9: PERFORMANCE METRICS
================================================================================

### Formula 9.1: Calibration Effectiveness

Effectiveness = Avg(Bet_recommended - Bet_final) / Avg(Bet_recommended)

Higher effectiveness = More calibration happening

Example (10 bets):
  Recommended: [$500, $1,200, $900, $400, $1,500, $800, $600, $1,100, $700, $1,000]
  Final: [$500, $750, $750, $400, $750, $750, $600, $750, $700, $750]
  
  Avg_recommended = $860
  Avg_final = $670
  
  Effectiveness = ($860 - $670) / $860 = 0.221 (22.1%)

22% average reduction applied by calibration layer

---

### Formula 9.2: Protection Score

Protection = (Bet_max / Max_Layer_Recommendation)

Lower score = More protection applied

Example:
  Max from layers: $2,500 (Decision Tree TURBO)
  Calibration max: $750
  
  Protection = $750 / $2,500 = 0.30

Only 30% of aggressive recommendation allowed (70% protection)

================================================================================
SECTION 10: COMPUTATIONAL PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

All calculations must be real-time (<10ms):

Operation                        Complexity    Time Target
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                                          <10ms

Result: Fastest layer, acts as instant sanity check

================================================================================
SECTION 11: STATISTICAL GUARANTEES
================================================================================

### Formula 11.1: Maximum Single-Bet Loss

L_max_single = B_0 × α_max = $5,000 × 0.15 = $750

Worst single outcome: -$750 (15% of original)

---

### Formula 11.2: Maximum 5-Bet Loss

L_max_5bet = 5 × Bet_max = 5 × $750 = $3,750

Absolute worst case (lose 5 in a row): -$3,750 (75% of original)

Probability: P = 0.40^5 = 0.01024 (1.02%)

Expected: Lose this much once per 98 five-bet sequences

---

### Formula 11.3: Survival Probability

P(Survive N bets) = 1 - P(Ruin in N bets)

For f = 0.15, p = 0.60:
  P(Ruin in 50 bets) ≈ 5%
  P(Survive 50 bets) ≈ 95%

For f = 0.20, p = 0.60:
  P(Ruin in 50 bets) ≈ 12%
  P(Survive 50 bets) ≈ 88%

15% rule improves survival probability significantly

================================================================================
SECTION 12: BANKROLL GROWTH WITH CALIBRATION
================================================================================

### Formula 12.1: Expected Growth Rate (With Cap)

For capped betting at fixed fraction f of original:

G = p × log(1 + f×b) + q × log(1 - f)

Where b = net odds (0.909 for -110)

Example:
  p = 0.60, f = 0.15
  
  G = 0.60 × log(1 + 0.15×0.909) + 0.40 × log(1 - 0.15)
    = 0.60 × log(1.136) + 0.40 × log(0.85)
    = 0.60 × 0.128 + 0.40 × (-0.163)
    = 0.077 - 0.065
    = 0.012 (1.2% per bet)

Expected growth: 1.2% per bet

---

### Formula 12.2: Bankroll After N Bets

B_N = B_0 × e^(G×N)

Example (100 bets):
  B_0 = $5,000
  G = 0.012
  N = 100
  
  B_100 = $5,000 × e^(0.012×100)
        = $5,000 × e^1.2
        = $5,000 × 3.32
        = $16,600

After 100 bets: 3.3× growth (vs 4× without calibration)

Trade-off: 25% less growth for 70% less risk

---

### Formula 12.3: Growth Comparison

Growth_with_calibration / Growth_without

For f_capped = 0.15 vs f_aggressive = 0.25:

Ratio = e^(G_15 × N) / e^(G_25 × N)
      = e^((G_15 - G_25) × N)

Example (100 bets):
  G_15 = 0.012
  G_25 = 0.018
  
  Ratio = e^((0.012 - 0.018) × 100)
        = e^(-0.6)
        = 0.549

With calibration: 55% of aggressive growth
But: 45% reduction in risk of ruin

Worthwhile trade-off for safety

Result: Strong protection against catastrophic loss
Trade-off: ~25% slower growth for 70% less risk of ruin

This is institutional-grade capital preservation.
