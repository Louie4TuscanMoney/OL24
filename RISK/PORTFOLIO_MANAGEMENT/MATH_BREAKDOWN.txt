================================================================================
SECTION 1: MARKOWITZ MEAN-VARIANCE OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

### Formula 1.1: Portfolio Optimization Problem

Maximize: w^T μ - (λ/2) w^T Σ w

Subject to:
  Σw_i ≤ 1.0  (total allocation ≤ 100% of bankroll)
  w_i ≥ 0     (no short selling in sports betting)
  w_i ≤ 0.20  (max 20% per bet)

Where:
  w = Vector of portfolio weights [w_1, w_2, ..., w_n]
  μ = Vector of expected returns [μ_1, μ_2, ..., μ_n]
  Σ = n×n covariance matrix
  λ = Risk aversion parameter (typically 1-2)

---

Example (3 games):

μ = [0.12, 0.15, 0.10]  (12%, 15%, 10% expected returns)

Σ = [ 0.040  0.012  0.008 ]
    [ 0.012  0.050  0.015 ]
    [ 0.008  0.015  0.035 ]

Solve for optimal w using quadratic programming:

w_optimal = [0.28, 0.35, 0.22]  (sum = 0.85 = 85% of bankroll deployed)

With $5,000 bankroll:
  Game 1: $1,400 (28%)
  Game 2: $1,750 (35%)
  Game 3: $1,100 (22%)
  Total: $4,250 (85%)

---

### Formula 1.2: Lagrangian Solution (Analytical)

For unconstrained case:

w* = (1/λ) Σ^(-1) μ

Where Σ^(-1) is inverse of covariance matrix

Example:
  λ = 2
  
  Σ^(-1) = [ 28.57  -5.71  -2.86 ]
           [ -5.71  24.00  -7.20 ]
           [ -2.86  -7.20  32.00 ]
  
  w* = 0.5 × Σ^(-1) × μ

This gives unconstrained optimal weights
Then apply constraints (sum ≤ 1, w_i ∈ [0, 0.20])

================================================================================
SECTION 2: SHARPE RATIO OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

### Formula 2.1: Portfolio Sharpe Ratio

Sharpe = (w^T μ - r_f) / sqrt(w^T Σ w)

Where:
  r_f = Risk-free rate (typically 0 for short-term bets)

Simplifies to:
Sharpe = (w^T μ) / sqrt(w^T Σ w)

---

Example (3-game portfolio):

w = [0.28, 0.35, 0.22]
μ = [0.12, 0.15, 0.10]

Expected return: w^T μ = 0.28×0.12 + 0.35×0.15 + 0.22×0.10
                       = 0.0336 + 0.0525 + 0.022
                       = 0.108 (10.8% expected return)

Portfolio variance: w^T Σ w (requires matrix multiplication)
                  = 0.0234

Portfolio std dev: σ_p = sqrt(0.0234) = 0.153 (15.3%)

Sharpe = 0.108 / 0.153 = 0.706

---

### Formula 2.2: Maximum Sharpe Portfolio

To find weights that maximize Sharpe ratio:

w* = Σ^(-1) μ / (1^T Σ^(-1) μ)

Where 1 = vector of ones [1, 1, ..., 1]

This is the tangency portfolio on efficient frontier

Example:
  Σ^(-1) μ = [2.86, 3.60, 2.40]
  1^T Σ^(-1) μ = 2.86 + 3.60 + 2.40 = 8.86
  
  w* = [2.86/8.86, 3.60/8.86, 2.40/8.86]
     = [0.323, 0.406, 0.271]

Maximum Sharpe weights: 32.3%, 40.6%, 27.1%

================================================================================
SECTION 3: EFFICIENT FRONTIER
================================================================================

### Formula 3.1: Efficient Frontier Equation

For target return μ_target:

Minimize: w^T Σ w
Subject to: w^T μ = μ_target
           Σw_i = 1

This traces out efficient frontier

---

### Formula 3.2: Parametric Form

Efficient frontier can be written as:

σ_p² = a × μ_p² - 2b × μ_p + c

Where a, b, c are constants derived from μ and Σ

This is a parabola in (μ, σ) space

Example:
  a = 2.5
  b = 0.3
  c = 0.01
  
  For target return μ_p = 0.10:
    σ_p² = 2.5×0.01 - 2×0.3×0.10 + 0.01
         = 0.025 - 0.06 + 0.01
         = -0.025 (must calculate properly)

---

### Formula 3.3: Tangency Portfolio (Maximum Sharpe)

The tangency point on efficient frontier:

μ_tangency = (b/a)
σ_tangency = sqrt(c - b²/a)

This is the portfolio with maximum Sharpe ratio

================================================================================
SECTION 4: RISK PARITY
================================================================================

### Formula 4.1: Risk Contribution

Risk contribution of asset i:

RC_i = w_i × (Σw)_i / sqrt(w^T Σ w)

Where (Σw)_i is the i-th element of Σw

For risk parity: RC_1 = RC_2 = ... = RC_n

---

### Formula 4.2: Risk Parity Weights

For diagonal covariance (uncorrelated assets):

w_i ∝ 1/σ_i

Example:
  Game 1: σ_1 = 0.20 → w_1 ∝ 5.0
  Game 2: σ_2 = 0.25 → w_2 ∝ 4.0
  Game 3: σ_3 = 0.15 → w_3 ∝ 6.67
  
  Normalized:
  w_1 = 5.0/15.67 = 0.319
  w_2 = 4.0/15.67 = 0.255
  w_3 = 6.67/15.67 = 0.426

Risk parity allocates MORE to low-volatility bets

---

### Formula 4.3: Risk Parity with Correlation

For correlated assets, solve:

w_i × (Σw)_i / ||Σw|| = constant for all i

Requires iterative solution (no closed form)

Result: Each bet contributes equally to portfolio variance

================================================================================
SECTION 5: CORRELATION ADJUSTMENT
================================================================================

### Formula 5.1: Correlation Matrix

For n games, build n×n correlation matrix:

Σ = [ 1.00   ρ_12  ρ_13  ...  ρ_1n ]
    [ ρ_21  1.00   ρ_23  ...  ρ_2n ]
    [ ...   ...    ...   ...  ...  ]
    [ ρ_n1  ρ_n2   ρ_n3  ...  1.00 ]

For games on same night:
  ρ_ij ≈ 0.20 (moderate correlation)

For same division games:
  ρ_ij ≈ 0.30 (higher correlation)

---

### Formula 5.2: Portfolio Variance with Correlation

Var(Portfolio) = Σ_i Σ_j w_i w_j σ_i σ_j ρ_ij

Example (3 games, equal weights w=1/3):

Var = (1/9) × [σ_1² + σ_2² + σ_3² + 2ρ_12σ_1σ_2 + 2ρ_13σ_1σ_3 + 2ρ_23σ_2σ_3]

With ρ = 0.20 for all pairs:
Var = (1/9) × [0.040 + 0.050 + 0.035 + 2×0.20×(cross terms)]
    = 0.0194

σ_p = sqrt(0.0194) = 0.139 (13.9%)

Without correlation (ρ=0):
Var = (1/9) × [0.040 + 0.050 + 0.035] = 0.0139
σ_p = 0.118 (11.8%)

Correlation increases portfolio volatility by 17.8%

---

### Formula 5.3: Diversification Benefit

Diversification_benefit = 1 - (σ_portfolio / Σw_i σ_i)

Example:
  σ_portfolio = 0.139 (actual)
  Σw_i σ_i = (1/3)×0.20 + (1/3)×0.224 + (1/3)×0.187 = 0.204 (sum of individual)
  
  Benefit = 1 - (0.139 / 0.204)
          = 1 - 0.681
          = 0.319 (31.9% diversification benefit)

Even with ρ=0.20, get 32% variance reduction from diversification

================================================================================
SECTION 6: KELLY-MARKOWITZ SYNTHESIS
================================================================================

### Formula 6.1: Individual Kelly Fractions

For each game i:
f_i = (p_i × b_i - q_i) / b_i

Where:
  p_i = Win probability for game i
  b_i = Odds for game i
  q_i = 1 - p_i

Example (3 games):
  Game 1: p=0.65, b=0.909 → f_1 = 0.187
  Game 2: p=0.70, b=0.909 → f_2 = 0.242
  Game 3: p=0.60, b=0.909 → f_3 = 0.132

---

### Formula 6.2: Naive Kelly Portfolio

Sum individual Kelly fractions:
f_total = Σf_i = 0.187 + 0.242 + 0.132 = 0.561 (56.1%)

Problem: This ignores correlation!

---

### Formula 6.3: Correlation-Adjusted Kelly

Adjusted total:
f_adjusted = f_total / sqrt(1 + (n-1) × ρ_avg)

Where:
  n = Number of bets
  ρ_avg = Average pairwise correlation

Example:
  f_total = 0.561
  n = 3
  ρ_avg = 0.20
  
  f_adjusted = 0.561 / sqrt(1 + 2×0.20)
             = 0.561 / sqrt(1.40)
             = 0.561 / 1.183
             = 0.474 (47.4%)

Reduce from 56.1% to 47.4% due to correlation (15.5% reduction)

---

### Formula 6.4: Optimal Weight Allocation

Allocate the f_adjusted proportionally to individual Kelly fractions:

w_i = f_adjusted × (f_i / f_total)

Example:
  Game 1: w_1 = 0.474 × (0.187 / 0.561) = 0.158 (15.8%)
  Game 2: w_2 = 0.474 × (0.242 / 0.561) = 0.204 (20.4%)
  Game 3: w_3 = 0.474 × (0.132 / 0.561) = 0.112 (11.2%)

With $5,000 bankroll:
  Game 1: $790
  Game 2: $1,020
  Game 3: $560
  Total: $2,370 (47.4%)

================================================================================
SECTION 7: QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING SOLUTION
================================================================================

### Formula 7.1: QP Standard Form

Minimize: (1/2) x^T P x + q^T x
Subject to: Gx ≤ h
           Ax = b

For portfolio optimization:
  x = w (portfolio weights)
  P = λ × Σ (covariance matrix scaled by risk aversion)
  q = -μ (negative expected returns)
  G, h = Inequality constraints (w_i ≤ 0.20, etc.)
  A, b = Equality constraints (Σw_i ≤ 1.0)

---

### Formula 7.2: KKT Conditions (Optimality)

At optimal solution w*, must satisfy:

1. Stationarity: ∇L = 0
2. Primal feasibility: Gw* ≤ h, Aw* = b
3. Dual feasibility: λ_i ≥ 0
4. Complementary slackness: λ_i(g_i^T w* - h_i) = 0

These conditions guarantee w* is globally optimal

---

### Formula 7.3: Computational Complexity

Solving QP with n assets:
  Time complexity: O(n³)
  
For n=10 games:
  Operations: 10³ = 1,000
  Time: ~30ms (with efficient solver like CVXPY)

For n=20 games:
  Operations: 20³ = 8,000
  Time: ~150ms

Scales cubically but acceptable for n≤20

================================================================================
SECTION 8: SHARPE RATIO MATHEMATICS
================================================================================

### Formula 8.1: Sharpe Ratio Definition

Sharpe = (E[R_p] - R_f) / σ_p

Where:
  E[R_p] = Expected portfolio return = w^T μ
  R_f = Risk-free rate (0 for short-term)
  σ_p = Portfolio volatility = sqrt(w^T Σ w)

---

### Formula 8.2: Maximum Sharpe Solution

To maximize Sharpe ratio:

w* = Σ^(-1) μ / (1^T Σ^(-1) μ)

This is the tangency portfolio

Example:
  Σ^(-1) μ = [2.86, 3.60, 2.40]
  Sum = 8.86
  
  w* = [0.323, 0.406, 0.271]

Maximal Sharpe weights

---

### Formula 8.3: Sharpe Ratio Improvement

Sharpe_portfolio vs Sharpe_individual:

For uncorrelated assets:
Sharpe_p = sqrt(Σ(Sharpe_i²))

For correlated assets (ρ ≠ 0):
Improvement is less than uncorrelated case

Example (3 bets):
  Individual Sharpes: [0.60, 0.75, 0.50]
  
  If uncorrelated (ρ=0):
    Sharpe_p = sqrt(0.36 + 0.56 + 0.25) = sqrt(1.17) = 1.08
  
  If correlated (ρ=0.20):
    Sharpe_p ≈ 0.89 (reduced by correlation)

Still improvement: 0.89 vs best individual 0.75 (19% better)

================================================================================
SECTION 9: COVARIANCE MATRIX ESTIMATION
================================================================================

### Formula 9.1: Sample Covariance

σ_ij = (1/(n-1)) Σ(r_it - μ_i)(r_jt - μ_j)

Where:
  r_it = Return on asset i at time t
  μ_i = Mean return on asset i
  n = Number of observations

Example (Games 1 and 2, 20 observations):
  
  Game 1 returns: [0.12, -0.08, 0.15, 0.10, ...]
  Game 2 returns: [0.15, -0.10, 0.18, 0.12, ...]
  
  μ_1 = 0.092
  μ_2 = 0.115
  
  Σ(r_1t - μ_1)(r_2t - μ_2) = 0.624
  
  σ_12 = 0.624 / 19 = 0.0328

---

### Formula 9.2: Correlation from Covariance

ρ_ij = σ_ij / (σ_i × σ_j)

Example:
  σ_12 = 0.0328
  σ_1 = 0.20
  σ_2 = 0.224
  
  ρ_12 = 0.0328 / (0.20 × 0.224)
       = 0.0328 / 0.0448
       = 0.732

Correlation between Game 1 and Game 2: 0.732

================================================================================
SECTION 10: PORTFOLIO METRICS
================================================================================

### Formula 10.1: Portfolio Expected Return

E[R_p] = Σ(w_i × μ_i)

Example:
  w = [0.28, 0.35, 0.22], μ = [0.12, 0.15, 0.10]
  E[R_p] = 0.28×0.12 + 0.35×0.15 + 0.22×0.10 = 0.108

Expected return: 10.8% for the night

---

### Formula 10.2: Portfolio Volatility

σ_p = sqrt(w^T Σ w)

Expanded:
σ_p = sqrt(Σ_i Σ_j w_i w_j σ_i σ_j ρ_ij)

---

### Formula 10.3: Maximum Drawdown (Estimated)

Estimated MaxDD:
MaxDD ≈ 2.5 × σ_p (for normal distribution)

Example:
  σ_p = 0.153 (15.3% per night)
  MaxDD ≈ 2.5 × 0.153 = 0.383 (38.3%)

Over multiple nights, expect max drawdown around 38%

================================================================================
SECTION 11: CONCENTRATION LIMITS
================================================================================

### Formula 11.1: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (Concentration)

HHI = Σ(w_i²)

Example:
  Equal weights: w = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]
  HHI = 4 × 0.25² = 0.25
  
  Concentrated: w = [0.50, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10]
  HHI = 0.25 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.01 = 0.34

Higher HHI = More concentrated

Target: HHI < 0.30 (well-diversified)

---

### Formula 11.2: Effective Number of Bets

N_effective = 1 / HHI

Example:
  HHI = 0.25
  N_effective = 1 / 0.25 = 4 bets

Even if portfolio has 6 bets, effectively like having 4 uncorrelated bets

---

### Formula 11.3: Concentration Penalty

Penalty = (HHI - Target_HHI) × λ_concentration

Add to objective function to discourage concentration

Example:
  HHI = 0.35
  Target = 0.25
  λ = 10
  
  Penalty = (0.35 - 0.25) × 10 = 1.0

Adds penalty of 1.0 to objective, encouraging diversification

================================================================================
SECTION 12: MULTIPERIOD CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

### Formula 12.1: Compound Return

For N game nights:

Final_Bankroll = Initial_Bankroll × Π(1 + R_i)

Where R_i = Return on night i

Example (5 nights):
  Returns: [+12%, -8%, +15%, +10%, -5%]
  
  Final = $5,000 × 1.12 × 0.92 × 1.15 × 1.10 × 0.95
        = $5,000 × 1.247
        = $6,235

---

### Formula 12.2: Geometric Mean Return

Geometric_Mean = (Π(1 + R_i))^(1/N) - 1

Example:
  GM = (1.247)^(1/5) - 1
     = 1.0453 - 1
     = 0.0453 (4.53% per night)

---

### Formula 12.3: Expected Final Bankroll

E[B_final] = B_0 × (1 + GM)^N

Example (80 game nights):
  B_0 = $5,000
  GM = 0.0453
  N = 80
  
  E[B_80] = $5,000 × (1.0453)^80
          = $5,000 × 39.8
          = $199,000

With 4.53% geometric mean per night: 40× over season!

(This is optimistic; reality likely 50-70% of this)

================================================================================
SECTION 13: REBALANCING
================================================================================

### Formula 13.1: Rebalancing Trigger

Rebalance when:

|w_i,current - w_i,target| > threshold

Typical threshold: 5% absolute difference

Example:
  Target: w_1 = 0.30
  Current (after price change): w_1 = 0.38
  Difference: 0.08 > 0.05 → REBALANCE

---

### Formula 13.2: Rebalancing Amount

For game i:
Trade_amount = (w_i,target - w_i,current) × Bankroll_current

Example:
  Target: 0.30, Current: 0.38
  Bankroll: $5,500
  
  Trade = (0.30 - 0.38) × $5,500 = -$440

Reduce position by $440

================================================================================
SECTION 14: PERFORMANCE METRICS
================================================================================

All calculations must be real-time (<50ms for 10 games):

Result: Real-time optimization for up to 10-15 games

For n=20: ~150ms (still acceptable for nightly optimization)
