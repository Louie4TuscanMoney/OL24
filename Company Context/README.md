**Company Mission & Vision:**

From Gemini, Grok, and Louie Weinhaus:

1. **Origin (April 2023):** Inspired by Jordan Peterson's interview using the term "ontological transcendence"

2. **Core Definition:** Ontologic XYZ is a data science startup building an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that transcends any other conclusion innovated by society with technology, or any problem antecedently solved to a societally accepted maximum potential.

3. **Proven Track Record:** Proprietary predictive technology stack rigorously proven in:
   - Low delta, high expected value NBA betting predictions
   - Sustained outperformance of S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Bitcoin benchmarks
   - Profitable execution in challenging negative-sum markets

4. **Vision:** Revolutionize intelligence, driving unparalleled innovation, decision-making, and transformative breakthroughs across all domains.

## How This Relates to ML Research Folder

The ML Research folder (parent directory) contains the **technical implementation** of Ontologic XYZ's vision:

- **3 Paper-Verified Models:** Informer, Conformal Prediction, Dejavu

## Why This Lives Here

**Company Context is separated from technical documentation to:**
1. Keep ML Research folder focused on models/code/data
2. Provide business context without cluttering technical docs
3. Allow non-technical stakeholders to understand company mission
4. Maintain clean separation of concerns (business vs. technical)
