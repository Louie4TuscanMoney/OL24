# Model Synergy Summary

**Quick Reference Guide - Conformal + Dejavu + LSTM Ensemble**

---

## The System in 3 Sentences

1. **Dejavu (40%)** finds similar historical game patterns → pattern matching
2. **LSTM (60%)** learns from patterns via neural network → pattern learning
3. **Conformal** wraps predictions with ±uncertainty intervals → statistical guarantees

**Result:** Accurate predictions (MAE ~3.5) with 95% coverage guarantees in <20ms.

## What Each Model Does

| Model | Input | Method | Output | Speed |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Dejavu** | 18-min pattern | K-NN similarity search | Point prediction (+6.2) | <5ms |
| **LSTM** | 18-min pattern | Neural network | Point prediction (+8.5) | ~10ms |
| **Ensemble** | Both predictions | 0.4×Dejavu + 0.6×LSTM | Combined (+7.6) | <1ms |
| **Conformal** | Ensemble + errors | 95th percentile quantile | Interval (±3.8) | <1ms |

**Total:** ~17ms from input to final output

## The Architecture (Parallel Ensemble)

```
Input: [0, +2, +3, +5, +7, +8, +9, +7, +6, +8, +9, +10, +11, +9, +8, +10, +11, +12]
       (18-minute scoring pattern - NO other stats!)
       │
       ├─────────────┴─────────────┐
       ↓                           ↓
   Dejavu                       LSTM

       └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                     ↓
              Weighted Ensemble
              0.4×6.2 + 0.6×8.5 = 7.6
                     ↓
              Conformal Wrapper
              7.6 ± 3.8 = [3.8, 11.4]
                     ↓
              Final Output:
              • Forecast: +7.6 points
              • 95% Interval: [3.8, 11.4]
              • Similar games: [2023-02-15, 2023-01-20, ...]

## Why This Works (The Synergy)

| Capability | Dejavu | LSTM | Conformal | **Ensemble** |
|------------|--------|------|-----------|--------------|
| Accuracy | ★★★☆☆ (MAE ~6) | ★★★★★ (MAE ~4) | N/A | **★★★★★ (MAE ~3.5)** |
| Uncertainty | None | None | ★★★★★ | **★★★★★ (95%)** |
| Interpretability | ★★★★★ | ★☆☆☆☆ | ☆☆☆☆☆ | **★★★★☆** |
| Speed | <5ms | ~10ms | <1ms | **~17ms** |

**Key Insight:** Each fills gaps the others leave. Together they're better than any individual model.

## Critical Misunderstandings (Corrected)

❌ **WRONG:** "Models use basketball stats (player stats, team ratings)"  
✅ **RIGHT:** Only the 18-minute scoring pattern. No other data!

❌ **WRONG:** "Historical data used during predictions"  
✅ **RIGHT:** Used ONCE to build models. Predictions only use current game pattern.

❌ **WRONG:** "Conformal uses confidence intervals"  
✅ **RIGHT:** Uses empirical quantiles (95th percentile of actual errors)

---

## Historical Data Usage

### Setup Phase (ONE TIME):
```
5,000 Historical Games
├─ 3,000 (60%) → Train LSTM, Build Dejavu database
├─ 750 (15%)  → Calibrate Conformal (calculate ±3.8)
└─ 750 (15%)  → Test set (evaluation)
```

### Prediction Phase (REAL-TIME):
```
Input: Current game pattern (18 numbers)
       ↓
Load pre-built models (Dejavu DB, LSTM weights, ±3.8)
       ↓
Output: Prediction + interval

Historical data? NOT accessed! Already "baked into" models.
```

---

## The ±3.8 Explained

**What it is:** 95th percentile of calibration errors

**How it's calculated:**
1. Run ensemble on 750 calibration games
2. Record errors: [2.0, 3.0, 4.0, ..., 3.8, ..., 8.2]
3. Sort and pick 95th percentile → 3.8
4. Use for all future predictions: forecast ± 3.8

**What it means:** "In 95 out of 100 calibration games, our error was ≤3.8 points"

**Why it's NOT a confidence interval:** It's empirical (actual errors), not parametric (assumptions about distributions)

## Performance Summary

```
Model               MAE      Coverage    Speed
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Dejavu alone:      ~6.0 pts    N/A       <5ms
LSTM alone:        ~4.0 pts    N/A       ~10ms
Ensemble:          ~3.5 pts    N/A       <15ms
+ Conformal:       ~3.5 pts    95%       <17ms
```

**Improvement:** 12.5% better accuracy than best individual model + statistical guarantees

## 🚨 Critical Gap: 60% Complete

### What Exists ✅
- Model architecture (Dejavu + LSTM + Conformal)
- Theoretical foundation (Conformal guarantees)
- Implementation specs (action steps)
- Documentation

### What's Missing ❌ (Production Blockers)
1. **Monitoring** - No alerts when models degrade
2. **Drift Detection** - No automatic retraining triggers
3. **Failure Handling** - No graceful degradation
4. **Calibration Validation** - No reliability diagrams
5. **Cost Tracking** - No unit economics
6. **A/B Testing** - No safe deployment strategy
7. **Retraining Pipeline** - No automated updates
8. **Latency SLA** - No timeout enforcement

**Reality:** Great ML architecture, missing operational infrastructure. Prototype → Production gap.

---

## Immediate Action Items

### Tier 1 (Critical - Build NOW):
1. ✅ Monitoring & alerting (catch failures)
2. ✅ Data validation (prevent garbage inputs)
3. ✅ Fallback mechanisms (graceful degradation)
4. ✅ Evaluation suite (calibration plots)

### Tier 2 (Important - Build Soon):
5. ✅ Drift detection (trigger retraining)
6. ✅ Retraining pipeline (automate updates)
7. ✅ A/B testing (validate improvements)
8. ✅ Cost tracking (unit economics)

## Dejavu vs Traditional ML

| Aspect | Dejavu (This System) | Traditional Sports ML |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Input** | 18 numbers (scoring pattern) | 50+ features (stats, injuries, etc.) |
| **Method** | Pattern matching (K-NN) | Regression, feature engineering |
| **Deployment** | Instant (no training) | Requires training + maintenance |
| **Interpretability** | ★★★★★ (shows similar games) | ★★☆☆☆ (black box) |
| **Maintenance** | Low (just update database) | High (roster changes, new features) |

**Key Advantage:** Simplicity. Proves patterns alone contain sufficient signal.

---

## Future Vision: 5-Layer Architecture

**Current (Layers 1-3):**
```
Prediction → Ensemble → Conformal → Interval [3.8, 11.4]
```

**Future (Layers 1-5):**
```
Prediction → Ensemble → Conformal → MCTS → Probabilistic Distribution
                                    (Layer 4)  (Layer 5)
```

**What Layers 4-5 Would Add:**
- **Layer 4 (MCTS):** Simulate 10,000 possible futures (shots, rebounds, turnovers)
- **Layer 5 (Calibration):** Aggregate into full probability distribution

**Output:** Instead of interval, get complete distribution:
```
{
  +5 pts: 5% likelihood
  +6 pts: 8% likelihood
  +7 pts: 12% likelihood
  +8 pts: 18% likelihood ← Most likely
  +9 pts: 15% likelihood
  ...
}
```

**Benefits:** Risk-adjusted decisions, any quantile, expected value calculations

**Challenges:** Computational cost, transition modeling, distribution calibration

## Honest Assessment

### Strengths ✅
- Novel architecture (heterogeneous + Conformal is rare)
- Pattern-only input (no feature engineering nightmare)
- Fast deployment (Dejavu works instantly)
- Production-ready performance (<20ms, 95% guarantees)
- Interpretable (shows similar historical games)
- Mathematical rigor (finite-sample guarantees)

### Limitations ⚠️
- Pattern-dependent (assumes patterns repeat)
- Black box core (LSTM not interpretable)
- Short-term only (6-minute horizon)
- Data-hungry setup (needs 5,000 games)
- Missing operations (monitoring, drift detection, etc.)

### Verdict 🎯
**Sophisticated ML architecture** that demonstrates mature engineering. The synergy is real—each model fills gaps others leave. But it's 60% complete: great models, missing operational infrastructure.

**This is the gap** that separates research prototypes from production systems.

## The Bottom Line

**1+1+1 = 5**

Three models (Dejavu, LSTM, Conformal), three paradigms (Memory, Learning, Statistics), one system.

- **What** will happen? → Ensemble forecast (+7.6)
- **How certain** are we? → Conformal interval (±3.8)
- **Why** this prediction? → Dejavu neighbors (similar games)

**That's completeness:** prediction + uncertainty + explanation.

This is what production ML should look like—not research toys or brittle hacks, but **engineered intelligence**.

Now build the operations layer and ship it. 🚀
