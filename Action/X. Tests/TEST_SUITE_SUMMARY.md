## Test Coverage

### Test 1: Kelly Criterion
**File:** `test_1_kelly_criterion.py`

**Tests:**
1. Probability conversions (American odds → decimal, implied prob)
2. ML interval → win probability conversion
3. Expected value calculations
4. Kelly sizing with strong edge
5. Edge filtering (skip small edges)
6. Performance (<5ms target)

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ -110 → 1.909 decimal, 0.524 probability
✅ ML +15.1 [+11.3, +18.9] vs -7.5 spread → 0.750 win probability
✅ $400 bet at 65% win prob → $96.36 EV
✅ Strong edge (22.6%) → $272.50 bet
✅ Small edge (1.5%) → SKIP (correctly)
✅ Average: 2.0ms (target: <5ms)
```

### Test 2: Delta Optimization  
**File:** `test_2_delta_optimization.py`

**Tests:**
1. Correlation tracking (ML vs market)
2. Gap z-score calculation (rubber band stretch)
3. Tension metric (mean reversion signal)
4. Delta sensitivity analysis
5. Hedge strategy selection
6. Performance (<15ms target)

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Correlation: 0.850 (simulated correlated data)
✅ Gap: 5.5 points, Z-score: 3.19σ
⚠️  UNUSUAL GAP - Mean reversion expected!
✅ Tension: 1.69 (moderate-high)
✅ Strategy: AMPLIFICATION, 1.30x
✅ Average: 12ms (target: <15ms)
```

### Test 5: Complete Integration
**File:** `test_5_complete_integration.py`

**Tests:**
1. Single game - complete 5-layer flow
2. Multi-game portfolio calibration
3. Extreme conditions (RED mode)
4. End-to-end performance
5. Safety limit enforcement
6. Reserve requirement validation

**Expected Output:**
```
Input: ML +20.0 [+17.0, +23.0] vs Market -8.0

Layer 1 - KELLY:          $272
Layer 2 - DELTA:          $354 (1.30x amplified)
Layer 3 - PORTFOLIO:      $354 (single game)
Layer 4 - DECISION TREE:  $406 (115% power)
Layer 5 - FINAL CALIB:    $750 (CAPPED)

✅ Complete flow: Real-time (<100ms)
✅ Final bet never exceeds $750
✅ Portfolio total never exceeds $2,500
✅ Reserve always maintained
