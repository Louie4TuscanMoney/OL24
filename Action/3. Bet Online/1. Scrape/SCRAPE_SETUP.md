âœ… Browser initialized in ~2000ms
âœ… Success
   Scrape time: 500-800ms
   Games found: 10-15
   âœ… PASS - Within target!
```

### Continuous Scraping (5-second intervals)
```bash
python betonline_scraper.py
```

**Expected:**
```
[Scrape #1] 19:30:00

## Optimizations Applied

**From BETONLINE_SCRAPING_OPTIMIZATION.md:**

1. **Persistent Browser** (saves 1500ms)
   - Browser launches once at startup
   - Reused for all scrapes
   - Connection pooling

2. **Resource Blocking** (saves 500ms)
   - Block images, fonts, CSS
   - Block analytics, ads
   - Only load essential HTML/JS

3. **Fast Wait Strategy** (saves 1000ms)
   - `wait_until='domcontentloaded'` (not 'load')
   - Short timeouts (2000ms max)
   - Fail fast on errors

4. **Cached Selectors** (saves 50ms)
   - Reuse CSS selectors
   - No re-querying DOM

**Total speedup:** ~3000ms savings = 7.8x faster!
