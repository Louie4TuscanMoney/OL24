## Why "After MVP"?

**MVP Status (Current):**
- ✅ ML Model working (5.39 MAE)
- ✅ NBA API streaming
- ✅ BetOnline scraping
- ✅ Risk Management (5 layers, tested)
- ✅ Frontend dashboard

**This is ENOUGH to start betting and generating data.**

**Folder 6 Enhancements:**
- 🎨 **3D Visualization** - Cool but not essential
- 🧠 **Model Optimization** - Requires live performance data

**Strategy:** 
1. Deploy MVP
2. Collect live performance data during NBA season
3. Use data to optimize models (Stretcher)
4. Add 3D visualization for premium user experience

**Don't optimize prematurely - let real data guide optimization!**

## 1. 3D Data Stream

**Purpose:** Immersive basketball court visualization with live play-by-play

**Concept:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          3D BASKETBALL COURT                 │
│                                              │
│   [Live players moving on court]            │
│   [Ball position updating]                  │
│   [Score overlays]                          │
│   [ML prediction heatmap]                   │
│                                              │
│   Updates: Every 5 seconds                  │
│   Technology: ThreeJS + NBA API             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Value:** Premium UX, not core functionality

**Read:** `1. 3D Data Stream/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 2. Model Optimization (Stretcher)

**Purpose:** Deep dive into model architecture optimization

**Concept:**
```
Take Dejavu + LSTM + Conformal
    ↓
Break open every component
    ↓
Analyze:
  - Feature importance
  - Layer contributions
  - Ensemble weights
  - Conformal calibration
    ↓
Optimize based on LIVE performance data
    ↓
Custom architecture tuned to NBA betting
```

**Why Wait:** Need real data to know what to optimize

**Read:** `2. Model Optimization/STRETCHER_CONCEPT.md`

## Timeline

**Phase 1: MVP (Current)** ✅
- Deploy current system
- Start generating bets
- Collect performance data

**Phase 2: Data Collection (Weeks 1-4 of NBA season)**
- Monitor ML accuracy
- Track edge realization
- Measure risk system performance
- Identify bottlenecks

**Phase 3: Optimization (Month 2)**
- Build Stretcher (custom architecture)
- Optimize based on live data
- A/B test improvements

**Phase 4: 3D Visualization (Month 3)**
- Add ThreeJS court
- Live play-by-play stream
- Premium UX features

## Decision: Why Not Build Now?

### 3D Visualization:
- Takes 2-3 weeks to build properly
- Delays MVP deployment
- Doesn't improve predictions or bet sizing
- Nice-to-have, not must-have

**Decision:** Build after MVP is profitable

### Model Optimization:
- Need live data to guide optimization
- Current 5.39 MAE might be optimal already
- Premature optimization is waste of time
- Let data tell us what needs work

**Decision:** Collect data first, optimize second

## Commitment to You

**We will NOT let perfect be the enemy of good.**

**Current MVP is:**
- ✅ Good enough to start betting
- ✅ Good enough to collect data
- ✅ Good enough to validate edge

**After 2-4 weeks of live data:**
- Then we optimize
- Then we enhance
- Then we perfect

**But first: DEPLOY AND VALIDATE!**
