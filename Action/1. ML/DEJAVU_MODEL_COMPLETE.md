# ‚úÖ Dejavu Model - COMPLETE

**Status:** MVP Ready for NBA Season  
**Performance:** 5.39 MAE | 94.6% Coverage  
**Location:** `Action/1. ML/X. MVP Model/`

---

## What Was Built

**Ensemble System (3 Components):**
1. ‚úÖ Dejavu K-NN (k=500) - 6.17 MAE
2. ‚úÖ LSTM (64h, 2L) - 5.24 MAE
3. ‚úÖ Conformal wrapper - 94.6% coverage

**Combined:** 5.39 MAE with uncertainty quantification

---

## Data Processing

**Source:** 6,600 NBA games (2015-2020)
- Loaded 6 seasons of play-by-play data
- Converted to minute-by-minute time series
- Extracted 18-minute patterns + 7-minute outcomes
- Split chronologically (60/10/15/15)

**Critical fixes applied:**
- ‚úÖ Target alignment (both predict minute 24)
- ‚úÖ Date-based splitting (not game-based)
- ‚úÖ Proper normalization (training stats for all)

---

## Research Verification

**All specifications followed:**
- ‚úÖ Dejavu: k=500, Euclidean, median (MATH_BREAKDOWN.txt)
- ‚úÖ LSTM: 64 hidden, 2 layers (06_INFORMER_TRAINING.md)
- ‚úÖ Ensemble: 40/60 weights (07_ENSEMBLE_AND_PRODUCTION_API.md)
- ‚úÖ Conformal: 95% coverage (05_CONFORMAL_WRAPPER.md)
- ‚úÖ Data split: 60/10/15/15 (03_DATA_SPLITTING.md)
