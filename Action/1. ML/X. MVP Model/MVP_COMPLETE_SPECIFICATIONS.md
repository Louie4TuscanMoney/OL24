## Model Architecture

### Component 1: Dejavu K-NN Forecaster

**Purpose:** Pattern matching for interpretability

**Specifications:**
```python
class DejavuForecaster:
    k = 500                    # Paper optimal
    distance = 'euclidean'     # L2 norm
    aggregation = 'median'     # Of k=500 neighbors
    database_size = 4003       # Training patterns
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Normalize query pattern: `(pattern - mean) / std`
2. Compute Euclidean distance to all 4,003 patterns
3. Find k=500 nearest neighbors
4. Return median of their outcomes

**Performance:**
- MAE: 6.17 points
- Speed: 68.87 ms/game
- Interpretable: Shows 5 similar historical games

### Component 2: LSTM Forecaster

**Purpose:** Learn temporal patterns for accuracy

**Architecture:**
```python
class LSTMForecaster(nn.Module):
    input_size = 1
    hidden_size = 64
    num_layers = 2
    dropout = 0.1
    forecast_horizon = 7      # Predict minutes 18-24
```

**Network:**
```
Input: (batch, 18, 1)
  ↓
LSTM Layer 1: 64 hidden units
  ↓
LSTM Layer 2: 64 hidden units
  ↓
Linear: 64 → 7
  ↓
Output: (batch, 7) → Take [-1] for minute 24 (halftime)
```

**Training:**
- Optimizer: Adam, lr=1e-3
- Loss: MSELoss
- Epochs: 50 (early stopping at 16)
- Batch size: 32
- Gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0

**Normalization (CRITICAL):**
```python
# Fit on training set ONLY
pattern_mean = np.mean(train_patterns, axis=0)  # Shape: (18,)
pattern_std = np.std(train_patterns, axis=0) + 1e-10

outcome_mean = np.mean(train_outcomes, axis=0)  # Shape: (7,)
outcome_std = np.std(train_outcomes, axis=0) + 1e-10

# Apply to inference
pattern_norm = (pattern - pattern_mean) / pattern_std
outcome_denorm = pred_norm * outcome_std + outcome_mean
```

**Performance:**
- MAE: 5.24 points
- Parameters: 50,887
- Training time: ~10 minutes

---

### Component 3: Ensemble

**Purpose:** Combine Dejavu + LSTM for best of both

**Weights:**
```python
dejavu_weight = 0.4    # 40%
lstm_weight = 0.6      # 60%
```

**Formula:**
```python
ensemble_forecast = 0.4 × dejavu_pred + 0.6 × lstm_pred
```

**Performance:**
- MAE: 5.39 points
- 12.7% better than Dejavu alone
- Provides interpretability + accuracy

---

### Component 4: Conformal Wrapper

**Purpose:** Add 95% confidence intervals

**Specifications:**
```python
alpha = 0.05               # 95% coverage
calibration_games = 932    # From held-out set
quantile = 13.04           # ±13.04 points
```

**Algorithm:**
1. Run ensemble on calibration set (932 games)
2. Compute errors: `score_i = |actual_i - predicted_i|`
3. Sort scores and pick 95th percentile: `quantile = 13.04`
4. Apply to new predictions: `interval = [pred - 13.04, pred + 13.04]`

**Performance:**
- Empirical coverage: 94.6%
- Target coverage: 95.0%
- Coverage gap: 0.4% (excellent!)

## Data Pipeline

### Training Data
- **Source:** 6,600 NBA games (2015-2020)
- **Format:** 48-minute time series (minute-by-minute differential)
- **Splits:** 60% train / 10% val / 15% cal / 15% test

### Preprocessing
1. Load NBA play-by-play CSVs
2. Convert to minute-by-minute time series (48 points)
3. Extract 18-minute patterns (minutes 0-17)
4. Extract 7-minute outcomes (minutes 18-24, includes halftime)
5. Split chronologically (NO SHUFFLING!)

### Critical Details
- **Pattern:** Minutes 0-17 differential
- **Outcome:** Minutes 18-24 differential (7 points)
- **Target:** Last outcome value (minute 24 = halftime)
- **Both models predict:** Minute 24 differential

---

## Inference Pipeline

**Step 1: Get live pattern**
```python
# From NBA_API: Get current game differential at each minute
pattern = [0, +2, +5, +7, +10, +12, +15, +17, +18, +20, +19, +21, +23, +24, +22, +20, +19, +18]
# 18 values: game start → 6:00 Q2
```

**Step 2: Dejavu prediction**
```python
dejavu = DejavuForecaster.load('dejavu_k500.pkl')
dejavu_pred = dejavu.predict(pattern)  # Returns single float
```

**Step 3: LSTM prediction**
```python
# Load LSTM
lstm = LSTMForecaster(input_size=1, hidden_size=64, num_layers=2, forecast_horizon=7)
lstm.load_state_dict(torch.load('lstm_best.pth'))

# Load normalization
norm = pickle.load(open('lstm_normalization.pkl', 'rb'))

# Normalize
pattern_norm = (pattern - norm['pattern_mean']) / norm['pattern_std']

# Predict
with torch.no_grad():
    x = torch.FloatTensor(pattern_norm).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(-1)  # (1, 18, 1)
    output = lstm(x)  # (1, 7)
    lstm_pred_norm = output[0, -1].item()  # Last step = minute 24

# Denormalize
lstm_pred = lstm_pred_norm * norm['outcome_std'][-1] + norm['outcome_mean'][-1]
```

**Step 4: Ensemble**
```python
ensemble_pred = 0.4 * dejavu_pred + 0.6 * lstm_pred
```

**Step 5: Conformal interval**
```python
conformal = ConformalPredictor.load('conformal_predictor.pkl')
lower = ensemble_pred - conformal.quantile  # -13.04
upper = ensemble_pred + conformal.quantile  # +13.04
```

**Step 6: Return**
```json
{
  "point_forecast": 18.5,
  "interval_lower": 5.5,
  "interval_upper": 31.5,
  "coverage_probability": 0.95,
  "components": {
    "dejavu_prediction": 20.0,
    "lstm_prediction": 17.5,
    "ensemble_forecast": 18.5
  }
}
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### 1. Normalization (MUST GET RIGHT!)
- LSTM requires normalization
- Use TRAINING SET statistics for ALL predictions
- Stored in `lstm_normalization.pkl`
- Apply to pattern (input) and denormalize outcome (output)

### 2. Target Alignment (VERIFIED!)
- Both models predict minute 24 (halftime)
- Dejavu: Directly predicts diff_at_halftime
- LSTM: Predicts 7 steps, take last one (minute 24)

### 3. Ensemble Weights
- Research default: 40/60
- Can be optimized on validation set
- Current: 40/60 gives 5.39 MAE

### 4. Conformal Calibration
- MUST use independent calibration set
- Never mix with training data
- Recalibrate every 100-1000 predictions in production
