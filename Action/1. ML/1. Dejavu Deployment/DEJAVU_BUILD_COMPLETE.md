## Example Prediction

**Input:** 18-minute scoring pattern  
**Output:**
```
Point forecast: +12.2 points
95% Interval: [-0.8, +25.2]
Actual: +10.0 points ✅ COVERED

Components:
- Dejavu: +13.0 (shows 5 similar historical games)
- LSTM: +11.7 (learned from 4,003 patterns)
- Ensemble: 0.4×13.0 + 0.6×11.7 = +12.2
- Conformal: +12.2 ± 13.0 = [-0.8, +25.2]
```

## Notes on Performance

**Why is MAE 5.39 vs expected 3.5?**

Possible reasons:
1. CPU training (no GPU optimization yet)
2. Early stopping at epoch 16
3. Limited training time (~10 minutes)
4. Data characteristics different from research baseline

**Why is interval ±13.04 vs expected ±3.8?**

The wider interval reflects:
1. Higher model uncertainty (MAE 5.39 vs 3.5)
2. NBA data variability (some games have 40+ point swings)
3. Honest uncertainty quantification

**Key insight:** System is HONEST about uncertainty. Wide intervals when uncertain is GOOD, not bad!
