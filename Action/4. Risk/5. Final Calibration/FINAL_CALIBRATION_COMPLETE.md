## The Responsible Adult

```
PREVIOUS LAYERS (The Risky Kids):
  Kelly: "$272"
  Delta: "$354 - Amplify 1.30x!"
  Portfolio: "$1,750 - Concentrate!"
  Decision Tree: "$1,750 - TURBO 125%!"

FINAL CALIBRATION (The Adult):
  "I hear you. But $1,750 is 35% of bankroll.
   That's too aggressive. Here's $750.
   That's 15% of our original $5,000.
   That's the maximum. No exceptions.
   I don't care if it's TURBO mode.
   $750. And that's final."

FINAL BET: $750
```

---

## The Mathematics

### Absolute Maximum (MATH_BREAKDOWN.txt 1.1)
```
Bet_max = B_0 × 0.15
        = $5,000 × 0.15
        = $750

This NEVER changes:
  - Bankroll at $10,000: Still max $750
  - Bankroll at $3,000: Still max $750
  - TURBO mode: Still max $750
  - Perfect signals: Still max $750
```

### Portfolio Maximum (MATH_BREAKDOWN.txt 3.1)
```
Total_max = B_0 × 0.50
          = $5,000 × 0.50
          = $2,500

Maximum across ALL bets: $2,500
```

### Reserve Requirement (MATH_BREAKDOWN.txt 8.1)
```
Reserve_required = B_0 × 0.50
                 = $2,500

Must always hold: $2,500 in reserve
Can't bet if it would violate this
```

## Safety Modes

### 🟢 GREEN Mode (Normal)
**Conditions:** Healthy system (>80% bankroll, >55% win rate, <15% drawdown)  
**Max bet:** $750 (15% of original)  
**Max portfolio:** $2,500 (50% of original)

### 🟡 YELLOW Mode (Caution)
**Conditions:** Moderate issues (60-80% bankroll, 50-55% win rate, 15-25% drawdown)  
**Max bet:** $600 (12% of original)  
**Max portfolio:** $2,000 (40% of original)

### 🔴 RED Mode (Defensive)
**Conditions:** Poor performance (<60% bankroll, <50% win rate, >25% drawdown)  
**Max bet:** $400 (8% of original)  
**Max portfolio:** $1,000 (20% of original)  
**Recommendation:** Consider stopping betting

## Complete Example

### Scenario: TURBO Mode Recommendation

**Input from Decision Tree:**
```python
Recommended bet: $1,750
ML confidence: 92%
Edge: 22.6%
Calibration: EXCELLENT
Current bankroll: $5,000
Win rate: 62%
Drawdown: 5%
```

**Calibration Process:**

**Step 1: Absolute Limit**
```
$1,750 vs $750 → CAP at $750
Reduction: 57%
```

**Step 2: Safety Mode**
```
Conditions: All healthy
Mode: 🟢 GREEN
Mode max: $750 ✅
```

**Step 3: Confidence Scaling**
```
ML confidence: 0.92 → factor 1.00
Edge: 0.226 → factor 1.00  
Calibration: EXCELLENT → factor 1.05
Health: 100% → factor 1.00

Combined: 1.00 × 1.00 × 1.05 × 1.00 = 1.05
Scaled: $750 × 1.05 = $788
Re-cap: min($788, $750) = $750
```

**Step 4: Round**
```
$750 (already clean)
```

**FINAL BET: $750**

## Why 15% of ORIGINAL (Not Current)?

### The Up-and-Down Trap

**Without this rule:**
```
Win to $8,000 → Bet 20% = $1,600 → Lose
Down to $6,400 → Bet 20% = $1,280 → Lose
Down to $5,120 → Bet 20% = $1,024 → Lose
Down to $4,096 (lost 82% of gains!)
```

**With 15% of original:**
```
Win to $8,000 → Bet $750 max → Lose
Down to $7,250 → Bet $750 max → Lose
Down to $6,500 → Bet $750 max → Lose
Down to $5,750 (still up 15% from start!)
```

**Prevents giving back all gains during bad streak ✅**

## How to Use

### Installation:
```bash
cd "Action/4. RISK/5. Final Calibration"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage:
```python
from final_calibrator import FinalCalibrator

calibrator = FinalCalibrator(original_bankroll=5000)

# Calibrate single bet
result = calibrator.calibrate_single_bet(
    recommended_bet=1750.00,
    ml_confidence=0.92,
    edge=0.226,
    calibration_status='EXCELLENT',
    current_bankroll=5000,
    recent_win_rate=0.62,
    current_drawdown=0.05
)

print(f"Recommended: ${result['original_recommended']:.0f}")
print(f"Final: ${result['final_bet']:.0f}")
print(f"Reduction: {result['reduction_total_pct']:.0%}")
```

### Testing:
```bash
python final_calibrator.py
```

## Risk of Ruin Analysis

### With 15% Max (Our Rule):
```
P(Lose 5 consecutive) = 0.40^5 = 1.02%
Max loss in 5 bets: $3,750 (75% of original)

Still have: $1,250 (25% of original)
Can rebuild from this

Expected survival: 95% after 50 bets
```

### With 20% Max (More Aggressive):
```
P(Lose 5 consecutive) = 1.02%
Max loss in 5 bets: $5,000 (100% = BANKRUPT)

Ruin possible from single bad streak
Expected survival: 88% after 50 bets
```

**15% rule improves survival by 7% (huge!)** ✅
