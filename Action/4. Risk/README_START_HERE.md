## 💡 How It Works

**Simple version:**
```
1. ML predicts halftime score
2. BetOnline shows market odds  
3. Kelly calculates optimal bet
4. Delta amplifies if gap is unusual
5. Portfolio optimizes across games
6. Decision Tree adds progressive betting
7. Final Calibration caps at $750 max
8. Place bet!
```

**Example:**
```
ML: LAL +20.0 [+17.0, +23.0]
Market: LAL -8.0 @ -110

Kelly:      $510  (optimal)
Delta:      $615  (1.21x amplified)
Portfolio:  $615  (single game)
Decision:   $615  (Level 1, FULL power)
Final:      $620  (rounded)

FINAL BET: $620 on LAL -8.0
```
