RESEARCH PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Model Uncertainty in Time Series Forecasting

Paper Quote: "We identify the search for an 'optimal' model as the main 
challenge to forecasting. Existing statistical forecasting models implicitly 
assume an underlying data generating process (DGP) coupled with distributional 
assumptions of the forecast errors that do not essentially hold in practice."

Three Sources of Forecasting Uncertainty (Petropoulos et al., 2018a):
1. Model uncertainty (which model to use?)
2. Parameter uncertainty (which parameters to select?)
3. Data uncertainty (which data to use?)

Paper Finding: "Merely tackling the model uncertainty is sufficient to bring 
most of the performance benefits"

Paradigm Shift:
Traditional: Select/combine statistical models → Estimate parameters → Forecast
Dejavu: Search reference set → Find similar series → Aggregate their futures

Paper Quote: "We argue that there is another way to avoid selecting a single 
model: to select no models at all."

Advantages Over Model-Centric Approaches (From Paper):
1. No model training required (instant deployment)
2. Tackles both model AND parameter uncertainties
3. No time series features extraction needed (direct data comparison)
4. No explicit DGP assumptions
5. Cross-learning enabled (leverages big data era)


RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS
================================================================================

1. DATA-CENTRIC FORECASTING PARADIGM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation: Forecasting Without Model Training
- Database of historical (pattern, outcome) pairs
- Query-time matching to find similar patterns
- Weighted aggregation of historical outcomes

Key Insight:
"Similar patterns lead to similar futures"
→ No need to learn complex function approximations
→ Let the data speak directly

Practical Impact:
- Deploy immediately (no training phase)
- Update continuously (add new patterns)
- Debug easily (inspect matched patterns)
- Transfer across domains (same algorithm)


2. CROSS-SIMILARITY MATCHING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation: Multiple Similarity Measures
- Euclidean distance (amplitude-sensitive)
- DTW (handles temporal warping)
- Correlation (shape-based)
- Cosine similarity (direction-based)

Key Insight:
Different similarity measures capture different aspects
→ Ensemble for robustness

Practical Impact:
- Robust to different data characteristics
- No single "best" measure
- Adaptive weighting based on validation
- Handles amplitude/phase variations


3. ONLINE ADAPTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation: Continuously Updating Database
- Add new (pattern, outcome) pairs as observed
- Sliding window for non-stationarity
- No retraining required

Key Insight:
Recent patterns more relevant for non-stationary data
→ Automatic drift handling

Practical Impact:
- Adapts to distribution shifts
- No batch retraining needed
- Real-time performance
- Natural concept drift handling

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE (FROM PAPER)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Metric: MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)
- Lower is better
- Scale-independent (averaging across series possible)
- Used in M4 competition as standard

Optimal Settings (From Paper Tables 3 & 4):
- Distance: DTW (statistically significant for monthly only)
- Pool size: k=500 (sweet spot, improvements taper after k>100)
- Preprocessing: YES (seasonal adjustment + smoothing)
  * Yearly: 30% less smoothing (span = 0.7h)
  * Quarterly: 30% less smoothing (span = 0.7h)
  * Monthly: 30% more smoothing (span = 1.3h)

Results - Similarity vs Benchmarks (All history, k=500, DTW):

Yearly (MASE):
- Similarity: 2.783 (BEST)
- ETS: 2.82
- ARIMA: 2.95
- Theta: 2.78
- SHD: 2.88

Quarterly (MASE):
- Theta: 1.21 (best)
- Similarity: 1.250 (2nd)
- ETS: 1.26
- SHD: 1.28
- ARIMA: 1.30

Monthly (MASE):
- ETS: 0.931 (best)
- Similarity: 0.932 (tied)
- Theta: 0.945
- SHD: 0.951
- ARIMA: 0.960

ETS-Similarity Simple Combination (From Paper):
- Yearly: 2.75 (BEST across all methods)
- Quarterly: 1.20 (BEST across all methods)
- Monthly: 0.920 (BEST across all methods)

Paper Quote: "The simple combination performs on par to Similarity for the 
yearly frequency, being much better than any other approach at the seasonal 
frequencies. Overall, the simple combination of ETS-Similarity is the best 
approach."

MCB Statistical Significance Tests (From Paper Figure 4):
- Yearly short series (≤6 years): Similarity significantly better than all
- All frequencies & lengths: ETS-Similarity significantly better than individual methods
- Monthly: DTW statistically different from L1/L2 (only frequency where it matters)

Key Finding from Paper: "Similarity is significantly better than the statistical 
benchmarks for the short yearly series. At the same time, similarity performs 
statistically similar to the best of the statistical benchmarks for other 
lengths and frequencies."

Prediction Intervals Performance (α=0.05, 95% intervals, From Paper Table 5):

Yearly:
                MSIS    Coverage    Upper Coverage    Spread
Similarity      26.43   88.68%      94.59%           13.57
ETS             37.01   81.58%      86.84%           11.97
ARIMA           81.58   77.26%      86.08%           8.36
Theta           39.57   80.85%      84.71%           8.87
ETS-Sim         26.81   89.59%      93.12%           12.77

→ Similarity BEST MSIS, BEST coverage for yearly

Monthly:
                MSIS    Coverage    Upper Coverage    Spread
Similarity      7.643   90.50%      95.87%           4.853
ETS             7.333   90.69%      94.22%           4.300
ARIMA           8.348   89.34%      94.66%           4.087
ETS-Sim         6.591   93.15%      96.44%           4.576

→ ETS-Similarity BEST overall for monthly

   - Extract (pattern, outcome) pairs
   - Normalize/preprocess

2. Database Creation:
   - Store patterns with metadata
   - Index for fast retrieval (optional)
   - Set up sliding window

3. Similarity Configuration:
   - Choose distance measure(s)
   - Set pattern length h

4. Validation:
   - Walk-forward validation
   - Tune hyperparameters
   - Compare multiple configurations

5. Deployment:
   - Query-time matching
   - Return forecast + matched patterns
   - Update database periodically


INFERENCE PIPELINE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Receive Query:
   - Most recent h observations
   - Normalize using same scheme as database

2. Compute Similarities:
   - Distance to all database patterns
   - Can use approximate K-NN for speed

3. Select K Neighbors:
   - Top-K by similarity
   - Or: All within threshold

4. Aggregate Outcomes:
   - Weight by similarity
   - Weighted average
   - Or: Median for robustness

5. Return Forecast:
   - Point prediction
   - Optional: Prediction interval from neighbor variance
   - Include matched patterns for interpretability


ONLINE LEARNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continuous Update Strategy:

Every T timesteps:
1. Observe new (pattern, outcome)
2. Add to database
3. If database > max_size:
   - Remove oldest (FIFO)
   - Or: Remove least-used
4. Recompute statistics if needed

Adaptive Windowing:
- Detect distribution shift
- When shift detected:
  * Reduce window size (forget old data faster)
  * Or: Increase decay weight on old patterns


PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to Use Dejavu:
✓ Need instant deployment (no training time)
✓ Limited training data (<10K samples)
✓ Non-stationary environment (frequent drift)
✓ Interpretability critical
✓ Pattern-rich domain (seasonality, cycles)
✓ Real-time updates needed
✓ Explainability to stakeholders

When NOT to Use:
✗ Very large datasets (>100K samples with capacity)
✗ Complex non-linear relationships not captured by similarity
✗ High-dimensional with sparse patterns
✗ No clear pattern repetition
✗ Real-time inference latency critical (K-NN can be slow)

Hyperparameter Guidelines:
- Pattern length h: Domain seasonality (daily=24, weekly=168)
- K neighbors: Start with 5-20, tune via validation
- Similarity: Try multiple, ensemble if helpful
- Database size: 1000-10000 typical, sliding window for drift
- Update frequency: Daily to weekly depending on domain
