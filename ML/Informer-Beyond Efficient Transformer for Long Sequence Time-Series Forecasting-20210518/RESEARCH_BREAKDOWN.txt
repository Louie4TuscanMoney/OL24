Source: Zhou et al., "Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence 
Time-Series Forecasting", AAAI 2021
Authors: Haoyi Zhou et al., Beihang University, UC Berkeley, Rutgers University
GitHub: https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020

RESEARCH PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenge: Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting (LSTF)
- Predict far future horizons (48-960 points tested in paper)
- Handle long input sequences (336-1440 timesteps tested)
- Real-world applications: energy grid management, weather, finance, sensor networks

Prior Methods Designed for Short-Term (<48 points):
- LSTM: Fails beyond 48 points (Fig. 1b in paper shows performance drop)
- Traditional methods (ARIMA, Prophet): Poor on long horizons  
- Vanilla Transformers: O(L²) complexity → impractical for long sequences

Paper's Motivation: "Can we improve Transformer models to be computation, memory, 
and architecture efficient, while maintaining higher prediction capacity?"


RESEARCH CONTRIBUTIONS
================================================================================

1. EFFICIENT ATTENTION MECHANISM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation: ProbSparse Self-Attention
- Identifies and selects only "active" queries that need attention
- Reduces complexity from O(L²) to O(L ln L)
- Maintains prediction quality while drastically reducing computation

Key Insight:
Self-attention in time-series is naturally sparse → most timesteps don't need 
to attend to all other timesteps, only to a few critical ones

Practical Impact:
- 3x faster training than vanilla Transformer
- Can process sequences 4x longer with same memory


2. FEATURE MAP DISTILLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation: Progressive sequence length reduction through network
- Each layer halves the sequence representation
- Focuses on dominant features while discarding redundancy
- Enables stacking more layers → capture longer dependencies

Key Insight:
Not all timestep representations need to propagate through all layers
→ compress and distill progressively

Practical Impact:
- Enables deeper networks without memory explosion
- Better long-range dependency modeling


3. GENERATIVE DECODER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation: One-shot full sequence prediction
- Predicts entire output sequence in single forward pass
- Uses masked multi-head attention to prevent information leakage
- Start tokens from input + zero placeholders for future

Key Insight:
Avoid autoregressive decoding → eliminates error accumulation and speeds inference

Practical Impact:
- L_y times faster inference than autoregressive models
- More stable long-horizon predictions


EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
